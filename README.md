I love snakes.<br>
We use java implement.<br>

The concept of the 2D game, called the snake game, is a normal game that was inspired by a game in the Nokia phone.<br>
That game was fun and easy to understand for my game: <br>
- Open up with the title game "Snake Game" with the button start & quit and 5 diffrent color as you like, you can choose it. <br>
- When you click start, the game starts with the snake with a 6-block body part that runs around the area, and one red dot that respawns randomly in the area. <br>
- When the snake eats the red dot, it increases the length of the snake by one, and the red dot randomly respawns another new one somewhere in the area. <br>
- The game will continue like this until the snake turns and bite it own body, and the game will be over. <br>
- When the game is over, it requires you to click anywhere in the area to return to the start menu. <br>
- That's all for the game concept.
